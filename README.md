#### Hello there, ElCholoGamer here.

I code decent Discord bots, and I'm practicing web apps using the MERN stack.

My preferred languages are (in order):
1. TypeScript
2. JavaScript
3. Java
4. (Maybe Python? Idk lmao)

Also I make some Minecraft plugins, check [this one](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/userlogin.80669/) out!
